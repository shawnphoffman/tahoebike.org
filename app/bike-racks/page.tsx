          <p>
            The Lake Tahoe Bicycle Coalition launched the Regional Bicycle Parking Program in 2018.
            Since its inception, the program has resulted in 450 bike racks (900 bike parking
            spots), and eight fix-it stations located on public lands and businesses in the Tahoe
            Basin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The environmental impacts of automobile congestion are a major concern to the fragile
            ecosystems surrounding Lake Tahoe and Truckee. Traffic delays contribute to high levels
            of carbon monoxide and reduce the quality of experience for visitors, quality of life
            for residents, and the quality of the environment for everyone. Studies out of UC
            Davis’ Sustainable Transportation Center have concluded that providing secure and
            proximate bicycle parking is a main factor in encouraging increased ridership.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lake Tahoe Bicycle Coalition launched the Regional Bicycle Parking Program in the Tahoe
            Basin to help implement TRPA and local plans, goals, and policies. The Coalition began
            with a bike parking needs assessment conducted by TRPA with support from LTBC in 2016.
            A similar effort was undertaken in Truckee in 2015 with the Trails and Bikeways Master
            Plan. By increasing bicycle parking the Lake Tahoe Bicycle Coalition will help
            implement TRPA and The Town of Truckee’s plans, goals, and policies, and increase
            bicycle ridership which would result in a reduction in air pollution.
          </p>

          <h2>Current Projects</h2>
          <p>
            The Lake Tahoe Bicycle Coalition now offers low or no-cost bike racks to interested
            businesses in Truckee, made possible through a generous grant from the Lahontan
            Community Foundation Fund held at the Parasol Tahoe Community Foundation. The program
            is designed to encourage locals and visitors to ride their bikes around lakeside
            communities instead of driving.
          </p>

              <p>
                Applications are open. Truckee businesses interested in bike racks are invited to
                apply using the form on this page. The Coalition is offering Hoop Runner or
                “Inverted-U” style bike racks, with bolt-down and free-standing versions
                available. Interested businesses will be selected by the Bike Coalition based on
                criteria that include their ability to provide matching funds, experienced or
                projected bike rack use, and community benefit based on surrounding businesses or
                services.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bike Coalition will be responsible for all orders, shipping, and delivery of
                the bike racks on behalf of the selected businesses.
