          <p>
            As part of our mission to help make Tahoe more bike friendly, the Lake Tahoe Bicycle
            Coalition is happy to provide safe and convenient valet bicycle parking for Tahoe’s
            community events, at no cost to the bicyclists. A bike valet is like a coat check for
            bikes!
          </p>
          <p>
            You can attract more people to your event and support biking in Tahoe when you host a
            bike valet. The Bike Coalition and our trained volunteers bring everything that is
            needed: portable bike racks, perimeter fencing, and a ticketing system to keep track of
            parked bicycles; and we are fully insured to cover any damage or theft issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a typical event, our rates start at ${settings.bike_valet_daily_rate} per day. Your
            investment helps cover the cost of maintaining our equipment, and because we are an
            all-volunteer organization, the rest goes straight to programs that promote biking in
            the Tahoe region. Nonprofit organizations and Bike Coalition Business Members may be
            able to secure the valet at a pro bono or discount rate. Please fill out the request
            form below to get started and receive a quote.
          </p>

          <h2>Volunteer</h2>
          <p>
            Our program is run by our volunteer board of directors and supported by amazing

            culture in Tahoe (and attend some fun events), please fill out our{" "}
