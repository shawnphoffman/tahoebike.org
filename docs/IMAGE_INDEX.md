# Image and alt-text index

Every image the public site shows, with the alt text it gets, grouped by page, for reviewing the alt text (docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md Q29). **Generated** by `pnpm content:image-index` (scripts/image-index.ts); do not edit by hand, re-run it after changing images or alt text.

How to change alt text:

- Images in page code: edit the `alt` in the file named in the *Used in* column (app/ and components/).
- Homepage cards and board headshots come from the database (seeded from prisma/seed-data.json by prisma/seed.ts). Their alt text is derived in the rendering component: cards are decorative (`alt=""`, the card title sits next to the image), and so are headshots (the member's name is the heading beside the photo). Change the derivation in the component; change the image or the name in `/admin` (or in prisma/seed-data.json before re-seeding). The rows listed here are the seed snapshot; rows added or edited in `/admin` since are not visible to the generator.
- Open Graph share images (`pageMetadata({ image })`) are what Facebook, Slack, etc. show for a link; their alt is the `og:image:alt` tag.

Alt text on the old site existed only for sponsor logos and board headshots (the member's name); the rest was written during the migration from the image content and file names, so it needs a human check. Photo credits: none were shown on the old site and none were added (Q29).

**57 image uses** (44 distinct files) across 10 sections; **34 unreferenced files** in public/images (last section).

Thumbnails are relative links into public/images, so they render in GitHub and VS Code previews. Sizes are the committed files; next/image serves resized copies.

## Unreferenced files in public/images

Nothing in app/, components/, the seeded rows or the icons references these. The dated folders hold every image the old WordPress site used somewhere (old sliders, footers, sponsor logos, unused attachments); each one's old `wp-content/uploads` URL still redirects here (lib/redirects.generated.ts), so deleting a file breaks inbound links to it. Sponsor logos may be wanted back once sponsors are decided. Files under `brand/` are the source artwork for the icons and the share image and are kept on purpose.
